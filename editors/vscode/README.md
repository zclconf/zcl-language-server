# zcl extension for Visual Studio Code

This directory serves two purposes. The first is to be a simple, generic
extension for Visual Studio Code to work with zcl configuration files.
The second is to serve as a starting point for building specialized extensions
for applications that use zcl as a configuration format, introducing
application-specific information.

It's currently serving neither of those purposes well, since it's in an early
prototype state.
